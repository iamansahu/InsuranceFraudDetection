# InsuranceFraudDetection

Every year, the insurance industry loses billions of dollars due to fraud. The act when a person makes fake insurance claims to gain benefits, compensation & other advantages to which they are not entitled is known as Insurance Fraud. Nowadays, insurance fraud detection is becoming a tedious problem for insurance companies to deal with as they need more investment and workforce to keep track of every transaction. In this project, we are focusing on the central issue faced by insurance companies, which is insurance fraud. We use the machine learning technique to detect insurance fraud based on the transactional data given by the insurance company. We build predictive models and compare their performance by calculating the confusion matrix; then, it is evaluated on various performance measuring parameters like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the AUC curve. The machine learning algorithms used are SVM (Support Vector Machine) and XG Boost (Extreme Gradient Boosting). After model evaluation, we select the best prediction model. In this project, using this dataset, we found XG Boost performing better than SVM. Best Model gave the expected output in terms of Fraud or Not Fraud.
